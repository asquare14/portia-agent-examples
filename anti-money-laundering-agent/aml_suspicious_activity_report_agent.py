        Goal: Generate a SAR report from the AML list.
        Steps:
        1. Read aml_list.txt
        2. Summarize suspicious activity:
        - Mention who, what, when, where, why.
        - Include transaction refs, dates, amounts, currencies, and counterparties.
        3. Add sections:
        - Reason for Suspicion (2â€“3 sentences)
        - Risk Indicators (bullets)
        - Flagged Transactions (one line per tx: ref, date, amount, receiver, reason)
        - Overall Risk (High/Medium/Low)
        - Recommendations (File SAR, EDD, monitoring)
        4. Use concise, factual, professional tone.
        5. Output plain text only, write that to a file called sar_report.txt.
